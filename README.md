This repository contains the implementation of a simulation environment for ant foraging developed starting from an environment focused on slime mold aggregation provided by professor Stefano Mariani.
Furthermore the possibility of applying MARL, and in particular the Q-learning algorithm in an independent learning setting, to the topic has been explored.
